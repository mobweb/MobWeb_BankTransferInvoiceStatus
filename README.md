# MobWeb_BankTransferInvoiceStatus extension for Magento

This simple extension enables the selection of a capture status when manually creating an invoice from the Magento backend. This status can be set to *"Not Capture"* to set the invoice's status to *"Pending"* and keep track of the payment status. Once the payment has been received the amount could be captured and the invoice's status would be set to *"Paid"*.

## Installation

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible.
